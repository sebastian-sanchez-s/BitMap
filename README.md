# BitMap
A simple library to create bmp images. Aimed to my learning process of image processing.

### Usage

#### Code
To create Images use

```C
struct BMP * image = BMP_create(width, height, color_depth, DIB_format)
```

To draw pixels first you must declare a color as:

```C
/* Each channel range between 0 and 2^{X} - 1; where X is the number of bits for that channel */
struct Color some_color = {blue_level, green_level, red_level, alpha_level}
```
or 
```C
struct Color some_color = {0};          /* {0} avoids noise (unwante level of some color)*/
some_color.red = some_red_value;
some_color.blue = some_blue_value;
some_color.green = some_green_value;
some_color.alpha = some_alpha_value    /* this will be applied only if the color depth is 32 bit */
```

> * 16 bit: RGB555 range between 0 and 31   (2^{5}-1).
> * 24 bit: RGB888 range between 0 and 255  (2^{8}-1).
> * 32 bit: same as 24 bit, it has alpha channel.

After creating a color, to draw a pixel you use:

```C
BMP_set_pixel(image, position_y, position_x, color)
```

If you already have an bmp image you can read it with

```C
struct BMP * image = BMP_read_from_file(filename);
```

### Examples
#### RBG Color Square in 16 and 24 bit
![Tones of RGB with 16 bit depth using RGB555](examples/colors_16.bmp)
#### The mandelbrot set 
![Mandelbrot set](examples/mandelbrot.bmp)

### To-do:
1. Support infoheaders 
  - BITMAPINFOHEADER
    + Color depths:
      * [-] < 8 bit
      * [x] 16 bit
      * [x] 24 bit
      * [x] 32 bit 
    + Compression:
      * [x] BI_RGB (no compression)
  - BITMAPV5HEADER
    + Color depths:
      * [-] < 8 bit
      * [x] 16 bit
      * [x] 24 bit
      * [x] 32 bit 
    + Compression:
      * [x] BI_RGB (no compression)
2. idk how to label this
  - [-] Give the option to override the image or duplicate.
  - [x] Create images.
  - [x] Read images.
